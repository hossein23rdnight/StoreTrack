## üìñ About The Project

StoreTrack is a complete inventory management solution built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It provides a user-friendly interface for businesses to manage products, track orders, and visualize sales data. This application was built to demonstrate a full-stack workflow, from backend API development to a dynamic, responsive frontend.

## ‚ú® Key Features

This application includes a wide range of features to provide a comprehensive inventory management experience:

* **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with password hashing.
* **Persistent Sessions:** Users remain logged in across browser sessions using `localStorage`.
* **Reporting Dashboard:**
    * At-a-glance metrics for total products, orders, and sales turnover.
    * Interactive charts to visualize sales quantity per product and revenue share by product.
    * A real-time list of products with low stock (quantity less than 5).
* **Product Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for products.
* **Order Management:**
    * Create new orders from a list of available products.
    * **Automated Inventory Reduction:** Creating an order automatically decreases the stock quantity of the included products.
    * Track and update order status (`Pending`, `Sending`, `Complete`, `Canceled`).
* **Category Management:** Organize products by creating and managing categories.
* **Search and Filtering:** Powerful client-side search and filtering on both the Products and Orders pages.
* **Stock Movement History:**
    * A complete audit trail (Inventory Log) of all stock changes.
    * Automatically logs stock **OUT** when an order is created.
